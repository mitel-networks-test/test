# Copilot Application Dependencies
# This file lists the required Python packages for the application

# No external dependencies required for the basic functionality

# - argparse (command-line parsing)
# - logging (logging functionality)
# - sys (system-specific parameters)
# - os (operating system interface)
# - typing (type hints)
# - platform (platform identification)

# Future dependencies can be added here as needed
